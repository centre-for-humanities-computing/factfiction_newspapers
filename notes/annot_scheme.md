# Categories

## y: 
fiction, narrative, story, etc. We annotate these as "y" (yes), even if they are not strictly fiction. For example, a story about a real event or person, but with a narrative structure.

## n: 
nonfiction, reportage, newsarticle, etc. We annotate these as "n" (no), even if they are not strictly nonfiction. For example, a story about a real event or person, but with a narrative structure.

## anecdote: 
often occurs in the "misceller" or "anekdoter" part of a newspaper. We annotate these as "anecdotes", which are short stories with characters (not without as are "essays"). Example: "thi_000144" (story about the 1757 malta hurricane)
**Note**: these may be very like "y", but we especially pay attention to their brevity (often < 1 page) and their often humorous or moralistic character.

## speech: 
political speeches, oratories (priests), etc. Often these begin with "so and so said" or "so and so spoke". We allow for a bit of opening sentences, but the majority of the text must contain the referred speech. We annotate these as "speech"

## bio: 
biography, autobiographical stories, etc. For example of Napoleon, or of a famous person. We annotate these as "bio", even if they are narrative in character. 
**Note**: When the text is more narrative than this, such as when having a strong internal focalization, such as with "confessions" or "memoirs", we annotate these as "y"

## essay: 
personal essays, opinion pieces, descriptions of nation or landscape etc. We annotate these as "essays". 
**Note**: If they contain characters, especially reffering the thoughts and feelings of the characters, we annotate these as "y".

## poem: 
anything arranged as a verse or poem on the newspaper page (even when included in a story). we annotate these as "poem", even if they are not strictly poetry.
