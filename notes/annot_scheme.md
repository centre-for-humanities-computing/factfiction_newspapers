# Categorues

## y: 
fiction, narrative, story, etc. We annotate these as "y" (yes), even if they are not strictly fiction. For example, a story about a real event or person, but with a narrative structure.

## n: 
nonfiction, reportage, newsarticle, etc. We annotate these as "n" (no), even if they are not strictly nonfiction. For example, a story about a real event or person, but with a narrative structure.

## anecdote: 
often occurs in the "misceller" or "anekdoter" part of a newspaper. We annotate these as "anecdotes", which are short stories with characters (not without as are "essays"). Example: "thi_000144" (story about the 1757 malta hurricane)
**Note**: these may be very like "y", but we especially pay attention to their brevity (often < 1 page) and their often humorous or moralistic character.

## speech: 
political speeches, oratories (priests), etc. Often these begin with "so and so said" or "so and so spoke". We allow for a bit of opening sentences, but the majority of the text must contain the referred speech. We annotate these as "speech"

## bio: 
biography, autobiographical stories, etc. For example of Napoleon, or of a famous person. We annotate these as "bio", even if they are narrative in character. 
**Note**: When the text is more narrative than this, such as when having a strong internal focalization, such as with "confessions" or "memoirs", we annotate these as "y"

## essay: 
personal essays, opinion pieces, descriptions of nation or landscape etc. We annotate these as "essays". 
**Note**: If they contain characters, especially reffering the thoughts and feelings of the characters, we annotate these as "y".

## poem: 
anything arranged as a verse or poem on the newspaper page (even when included in a story). we annotate these as "poem", even if they are not strictly poetry.




# Double contract

Often, fiction is presented as a true event, or even as a true event as well as "fortælling" (example?)
However, it is often clear that this is fiction, for example when telling about shippery in the 16th century (i.e., 200 years prior)
for example this story: thi_opdagelsesrejse-cape-breton; where the castaway son is in the end recognized by his family via a birthmark on his knee – true Ulysses fashion.

eller "En fuldkommen sand Tildragelse" som "thi_quirks-of-fate" - "En Fortælling af Dr. Buchwalds egen Mund, indenstaaer for Sandheden af denne nøiagtig fortalte Historie."


## naval chronicle
often these are from [the naval chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Chronicle) i.e. "reports" and "bios" included 
– we might want to try and remove the ones containing "naval" to see how that changes things?

"En literair Proces, svæver i denne Tid for Retter ere i Paris: Veron og Gerardin Medeiere af BladeConstitutionel have indklaget den verdensberømte Romanforfatter Alexander Dumas, der leverer deres Feuilleton, fordi han ved Contrakt havde forpligtet sig til i 5 Aar ikke at levere mere end 18 Bind, Romaner og Aaret; da han indgik denne Contract havde han endnu 175,000 Linier at levere til andre Blade; denne enorme Frugtbarhed paa literaire Frembringelser, synes dog at have generet den aandrige Mand, siden han for Retten erklærede, at han i 18 Maaneder havde produceret 158000 Linier, men var blevet saa træt deraf, at han forat recreere sig, maatte foretage en Reise til Spanien og Afrika."
